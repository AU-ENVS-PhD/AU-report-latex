abstract = {This index of green foliage density is a fundamental attribute of the landscape, describing the absorption of sunlight, photosynthetic capac-ity, and evaporation rates. These physical and biological processes are primary descriptors of how land conditions modulate the Earth system (Sellers et al., 1995). Once it was understood that space-based Earth imaging could provide such information about land patterns and dynamics, the possibility of developing fully integrated land-ocean-atmos-phere monitoring and modeling capabilities was realized. Landsat image data provide one of the most important elements of Earth observation needed to develop the concept of Earth Systems Science (Goward and Williams, 1997) The Politics of Landsat Given its important role in Earth observation, one would think that the Landsat program has been managed with great care over its more than three decades of existence, but unfortunately the Landsat mission has experienced a variety of stresses over its lifetime (Lauer et al., 1997; Mack, 1990). Developed originally as an experimental demonstration of capabilities by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration (NASA), Landsat never found a comfortable opera-tional home (Marshall, 1989a; Marshall, 1989b; National Research Council, 1985 and 1995) The Land Remote Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984 (Public Law 98â€“365, 1984) charged the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with the task of transferring the Landsat program to the private sector. The Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT) was awarded a contract to take over operations of Landsats 4 and 5 for ten years and to develop and build two new satellites, including the ground system. Over the next decade, numerous problems were encountered including substantially increased data costs, limited global acquisi-tions, severe data exchange constraints, and a failure to successfully place Landsat-6 in Earth orbit. In 1992, on the heels of the Department of Defense's (DOD) successful Desert Storm activities in Iraq and Kuwait, the U.S. Congress passed U.S. Public Law 102-555 to return the Landsat mission to Federal government management (Public Law 102-555, 1992). In the years following, several different Federal agencies (DOD, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological 1172 O c t o b e r 2 0 0 6},
